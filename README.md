# vidjot_node_express

Project from Brad Traversy Node Express Mongo course

### Install express

```sh
npm install --save express
```

### Install nodemon globally

It watches changes on files so that the server doesn't need to be restarted on every change.

```sh
npm install --g nodemon
```

### Start server

```sh
node app.js
```

or

```sh
node app
```
